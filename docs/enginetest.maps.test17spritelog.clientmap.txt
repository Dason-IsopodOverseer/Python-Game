     |  Methods inherited from engine.clientmap.ClientMap:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, tilesets, mapDir)
     |      Set defaults, sort data, and allocate images (pygame surfaces) for rendering.
     |  
     |  blitBottomImage(self, destImage, offset)
     |      Blit together all the visible layers BELOW the sprite layer.
     |      
     |      Store in self['bottomImage']. self['bottomImage'] can then be used for faster
     |      screen updates rather than doing all the work of blitting these layers together
     |      every frame.
     |      
     |      Note object layer "sprites" will not be rendered since is is
     |      provided by the server and must be rendered separately with a direct
     |      call to blitObjectList()

     |              position. The length of the list must match the number of tiles
     |              that make up the map. Tile order is top left corner first, then
     |              move right to end of row and then move down to next row (right-down).

     |      together every frame.
     |      
     |      Note object layer named "sprites" will not be rendered since

     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Methods inherited from engine.map.Map:
     |  
     |  __str__(self)
     |      Return str(self).
     |  
     |  addFollower(self, leaderObject, followerObject)
     |      Add leaderObject/followerObject relationship to self['follow']
     |      This also records the relative position of the objects.
     |      
     |      This information is used by setObjectLocationByAnchor() and setObjectMap()
     |      and causes the followerObject to follow the position of the leaderObject.
     |      
     |      Once a followerObject has been added it should not longer be used with
     |      setObjectLocationByAnchor() or setObjectMap(), only the leaderObject
     |      should.
     |  
     |  addObject(self, object, objectList=False)
     |      Add a Tiled object to an object list.
     |      
     |      Used to add Tiled objects (e.g. sprites) to the object list of a layer.
     |      The default objectList is self['sprites'].
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          object (dict): Tiled object
     |          objectList (dict): An objectList from a layer on this map.
     |  
     |  checkKeys(self, object, props)
     |      Check if all props are keys in object.
     |      
     |      This can be used by a method to check if an object has all the
     |      data required. If data is missing then a warning
     |      is logged that suggests where the data may be missing from.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          object (dict): Tiled object
     |          props (list): A list of keys. e.g. ["prop-deltaX", "anchorX"]
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |          bool: True if all props are in object else False
     |  
     |  checkLocation(self, object, newAnchorX, newAnchorY, ignoreInBounds=False)
     |      Check if a location for an object is valid.
     |      
     |      Determines if (newAnchorX, newAnchorY) would be a valid anchor point for
     |      object while taking several things into account, including map size, inBounds layer,
     |      and outOfBounds layer, collision with other sprites.
     |      
     |      Note, the priority evaluation is as follows:
     |      1) if object collides (overlaps) with another sprite then it is NOT valid.
     |         Note, two objects with collisionType == 'anchor' are allowed in the same location.
     |      2) if object does not fully collide (overlap) with the map then it is NOT valid.
     |      3) if object collides (overlaps) with an object on the outOfBounds layer then it is NOT valid.
     |      4) if the inBounds layer is empty or ignoreInBounds == True then it IS valid
     |      5) if object is fully inside an object or objects on the inBounds layer then it IS valid.
     |      6) else it is NOT valid.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          object (dict): A Tiled object.
     |          newAnchorX (float): x coordiate to check if valid
     |          newAnchorY (float): y coordiate to check if valid
     |          ignoreInBounds (bool): if True then do not consider inBounds layers (default False)
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |          bool: True if an anchor point of (newAnchorX, newAnchorY) would be a valid for object, else False
     |  
     |  checkObject(self, object)
     |      Check that object has required keys.
     |      
     |      Ensure object meets all basic criteria that are required by the server.
     |      If an empty object ({}) is passed then it is populated with default
     |      values until it meets the minimum requirements of a Tiled object.
     |      
     |      The minimum object contains:
     |      {
     |          'name': (str)
     |          'type': (str)
     |          'x': (float)
     |          'y': (float)
     |          'width': (float)
     |          'height': (float)

     |          'anchorY': (float)
     |          'collisionType': (str) One of 'none', 'anchor', 'rect', 'circle'
     |          'mapName': (str) The last map the object was on (or is still on).
     |      
     |          Only for tile objects have the following:

     |  
     |  convertTiledColor(self, tiledColor)
     |      Convert Tiled color HEX format to pygame format.
     |      
     |      Tiled hex colors with alpha are '#AARRGGBB' format but pygame
     |      needs '#RRGGBBAA' so flip alpha to the end.
     |  
     |  convertTiledProps(self, object)
     |      Convert Tiled properties to easy to use format.
     |      
     |      If 'properties' is in object then remove it and
     |      add prop-<name> to object for each property in
     |      'properties'.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          object (dict): An object to evaluate.
     |  
     |  findGid(self, tilesetSearchName, tilesetTileSearchNumber)
     |      Converts a tileset specific tile number to a Gid of this map.
     |      
     |      This requires that tilesetSearchName is a tileset in this map!

     |          objectList (dict): a list of objects to search. default is self['sprites']
     |          exclude (dict): a Tiled object. Skip this object while searching. Normally used
     |              to ensure an object does not find itself.
     |          returnAll (bool): Return a list of all matching objects, else return only the first
     |              matching object found.
     |      
     |      Returns: (one of the following)
     |          object (dict): A single Tiled object if a matching object was found and returnAll==False.

     |      LAYER VISABILITY MECHANIC: Return bit mask for the visibility of all layers in self['layers']
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |          layerVisabilityMask (int): bitmask where left most bit relates
     |              the visibility of layerIndex 0, the next bit relates to

     |      
     |      Used to remove Tiled objects (e.g. sprites) from the object list of a layer.
     |      The default objectList is self['sprites'].
     |

     |      of all layers on this map.
     |      
     |      Note, this does not alter object['mapName'] since the object could

     |  setObjectLocationByAnchor(self, object, anchorX, anchorY)
     |      Set an objects location using its anchor point.
     |      
     |      Updates an object anchor point and then sets it x, y to match.
     |      Also updates the relative position of any following objects.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          object (dict): A Tiled Object
     |          x (float)
     |          y (float)
     |  
     |  setObjectLocationByXY(self, object, x, y)
     |      Set an objects location using its top/left corner.
     |      
     |      Updates an object x,y and then sets it anchor point to match.
     |      
     |      ***Do not use without good reason. Most objects should have their
     |      location set by setObjectLocationByAnchor()***

     |  
     |  setObjectMap(self, object, destMap)
     |      Move a Tiled object to a different map.
     |      
     |      Remove object from all known layers on this map and add
     |      it to the same layers on destMap. Also move any following
     |      objects to the new map.

     |      D.update([E, ]**F) -> None.  Update D from dict/iterable E and F.
     |      If E is present and has a .keys() method, then does:  for k in E: D[k] = E[k]
     |      If E is present and lacks a .keys() method, then does:  for k, v in E: D[k] = v
     |      In either case, this is followed by: for k in F:  D[k] = F[k]
