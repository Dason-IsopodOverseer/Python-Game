     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, args)
     |      Extends __init__()
     |      
     |      Adds Attributes:
     |      
     |      self['mode'] which contains one of three values:
     |          1) waitingForPlayers: Game has not started.
     |          2) gameOn: All players have joined and game.
     |          3) gameOver: Game objective is complete.
     |      
     |      self['quitAfter'] which tells the server when to quit. Set
     |          when mode == gameOver so players will have time to see the
     |          game has been won before everything quits.
     |  
     |  addPlayer(self, ip, port, ipport, msg)
     |      Extends addPlayer()
     |      
     |      Show game opening marqueeTest until all players have joined the
     |      game and then set mode to "gameOn" and change the marqueeTest.
     |  
     |  msgPlayerAction(self, ip, port, ipport, msg)
     |      Extends msgPlayerAction()
     |      
     |      ignore playerAction msgs until all players have joined game.
     |  
     |  msgPlayerMove(self, ip, port, ipport, msg)
     |      Extends msgPlaeryMove()
     |      
     |      ignore playerMove msgs until all players have joined game,
     |      self['mode'] == "gameOn".
     |      
     |      Once all players have joined game, if a player moves then
     |      remove their marqueeTest.
     |  
     |  stepServerStart(self)
     |      Extends stepServerStart()
     |      
     |      If the mode is gameOn then evaluate if all
     |      players have made it to the stone circle. If they have then
     |      change mode to gameOver and set the timer to shutdown the
     |      server.
     |      
     |      If the mode is gameOver then check if the quitAfter is in the
     |      past. If it is then tell clients the server is quiting and
     |      then quit the server process.

     |          dict: A correctly filled out addServer msg.
     |  
     |  getPlayerChanged(self, player)
     |      Return True if player has changed since last call to self.resetPlayerChanged() else returns False.

     |      If server is using connector
     |      (self['registerName'] != False) then send a udpPunchThrough to the
     |      client public ip/port. Do this even if it looks like client and
     |      and server are on the same LAN or same host. It does not matter
     |      if this msg reaches the client, only that it opens the server's
     |      LAN NAT so msgs are allowed from the client to the server.
     |      The client can then find the best path (localhost/lan/wan) to
     |      reach the server.

     |  resetPlayerChanged(self, player)
     |      Update player so calls to self.getPlayerChanged will return False until the player is changed again.

     |      Args:
     |          player (dict): A player from self['players']
     |  
     |  run(self)
     |      Main server loop.
     |      
     |      This loop is controlled to run once every 1/fps seconds.
     |      Every loop it received msgs from players, takes one step forward in time,
     |      sends updated step messages to players, and keeps the connector data
     |      current (if required). It also prints server busy messages on a regular
     |      interval.
     |  
     |  sendConnectorKeepAlive(self)
     |      Keep server data in connector from timing out.
     |      
     |      If we are using the connector (self['registerName'] != False) then
     |      send addServer msgs to the connector at a regular interval until
     |      all players have joined the game. This will ensure the connector
     |      does not remove this server data based the connectors timeout. This
     |      also keeps the UDP punch through in the server's LAN NAT open so
     |      the connector can send msgs.
     |      
     |      This method should be called regularly (in main loop) after the
     |      addServer msgs has been accepted by the connector.
     |  
     |  sendStepMsgs(self)
     |      Send step msgs.
     |      
     |      Send a step msg to each player, but only if the map the
     |      player is on has changed or the player has changed.
     |  
     |  setPlayerActionText(self, playerNumber, actionText)
     |      Update the player's actionText to actionText.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          playerNumber (int): A player's playerNumber
     |          actionText (str): A string to display to the user in the action text box.
     |  
     |  setPlayerMarqueeText(self, playerNumber, marqueeText)
     |      Update the player's marqueeText to marqueeText.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          playerNumber (int): A player's playerNumber
     |          marqueeText (str): A string to display to the user in the marquee text box.
     |  
     |  stepServer(self)
     |      Take the game one "step" forward in time.
     |      
     |      This should be called once every 1/fps seconds by the main server loop.
     |      Three tasks are performed:
     |          1) call self.stepServerStart()
     |          2) call map.stepMap() for each map that has at least one player on it.
     |             Perform these calls in order of maps names sorted alphabetically.
     |          3) call self.stepServerEnd()
     |  
     |  stepServerEnd(self)
     |      Server logic for the end of a step.
     |      
     |      Placeholder that can be overridden in sub-classes to perform any game
     |      logic for the end of a step. This is any logic that is not map
     |      specific and is called after all map step processing is performed.
